<p>Software is becoming the heartbeat of our society. It binds our lives and work. Software development is increasingly sophisticated and difficult, no longer the effort of an individual but the aggregated work of many.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.scrum.org/">Scrum.org</a>, we’ve assembled a learning community to help improve the profession of software development. We believe the building blocks of great software are creativity, collaboration, and short cycle development that allows you to fail and recover quickly to try again and succeed. Scrum is a straightforward framework that teams around the world have used to create all kinds of software over the past 20 years. Join us.</p>
